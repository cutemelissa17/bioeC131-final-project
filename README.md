# BioE C131 Final Project
- Team Name: M.E.M 
- Team Members: Ekta Jaswal, Maria Isabella Solorzano, Melissa Theodorus  
- Viral Genome Family: HerpesVirus 

## Overview
This project focuses on the Herpesvirus family, particularly HSV-1, exploring the Latency-Associated Transcript (LAT) region and its regulatory interactions with flanking genes ICP0 and ICP34.5. Our database provides insights into viral latency and reactivation mechanisms, contributing to a better understanding of this virus's clinical impact.

## Features
- Focused analysis on LAT, ICP0, and ICP34.5 regions of the HSV-1 genome
- Provides a resource for studying viral replication, latency, and reactivation
